job, work, money, fun, activity
In this post, I remember seeing something about work. I didn't see much other than that. 
Work, family, house, other people, friends.

yard, work, 19-22, I honestly am terrible at tasks like that. My extreme short-term memory is very bad. I don't think I can get close to 75%. The word map was gone as soon as I realized what I was looking at. I will return this HIT if I feel like I may get rejected. I think it is kind of unfair to require 75% for approval. And the way mTurk is set up unfortunately, "receive payment" is synonymous with approval, because you can't give approval without giving payment. /  / I know I saw something about "YARD" in there.
